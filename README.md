# Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-Prediction
Machine Learning based behavioral analytics are needed to develop accurate prediction models for detecting the risk of autism faster than the traditional diagnostic methods. Autism Spectrum Disorder is a neuro-disorder in which a person has a lifelong effect on interaction and communication with others. Autism can be diagnosed at any stage in once life and is said to be a “behavioral disease”. ASD problem starts with childhood and continues to keep going on into adolescence and adulthood. In the current times, clinical standardized tests are the only methods which are being used, to diagnose ASD. This not only requires prolonged diagnostic time but also faces a steep increase in medical costs. To improve the precision and time required for diagnosis, machine learning techniques are being used to complement the conventional methods. Early detection and treatment are most important steps to be taken to decrease the symptoms of autism spectrum disorder problem and to improve the quality of life of ASD suffering people.
